**Assignment 1** - Smart Watch
Since you are a student of Manipal University, you are expected to work hard and get better results
than others. To track your time and expected performance in the Machine Learning Challenge,
your mentor has asked you to install walkatime on your device which is an efficient time
tracking tool to track your daily coding activity.
In this challenge, your mentor gives you walkatime data of his past students and how they
performed in the evaluation exam. Your task is to predict the score you will get given the
amount of time you spend on coding daily.
Input- You are given one feature corresponding to time noted by walkatime.
Output- A scalar denoting the level of performance students achieved by devoting the given
time.

**Assignment 2** - Chemicals Segregation
Can you Separate the chemicals?
Binary Classification Challenge
A chemist has two chemical flasks labelled 1 and 0 which contains two different chemicals.
He extracted 3 features from these chemicals in order to distinguish between them. You are
provided with the results derived by the chemist and your task is to create a model that will
label chemical 0 or 1 given its three features.

**Assignment 3** - Machine Learning in Health
Diabetes is a condition that impairs the body's ability to process blood glucose, otherwise known
as blood sugar. In the United States, the estimated number of people over 18 years of age with
diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes is 30.2 million. The figure represents between 27.9 and
32.7 percent of the population.
Without ongoing, careful management, diabetes can lead to a buildup of sugar in the blood,
which can increase the risk of dangerous complications, including stroke and heart disease.
Different kinds of diabetes can occur, and managing the condition depends on the type. Not all
forms of diabetes stem from a person being overweight or leading an inactive lifestyle. In fact,
some are present from childhood.
Challenge
In this problem you are given a Diabetes Data set consisting of the following features -
['Pregnancies', 'Glucose', 'BloodPressure', 'SkinThickness',
'Insulin', 'BMI', 'DiabetesPedigreeFunction', 'Age', 'Outcome']
and your task is to predict whether a person is suffering from diabetes or not (Binary
Classification)
Tasks
1) Plot a bar graph showing number of classes and no of examples in each class.
2) Classification Task, classify a person as a 0 or 1 (Diabetic or Not) using K-Nearest Neighbors
classifier.

**Assignment 4** - Air pollution
Air Pollution is Rising!
Predicting Pollution Levels using Machine Learning
It is winter time in Delhi so Cody decided to go for a walk to the news stand and on reaching
was surprised to see the air quality index of Delhi in the newspaper . So he decided to collect
the air samples of different locations and then took these samples to his lab where he extracted
five features of the air he collected which can be used to predict the air quality index and
combined it with the air quality index given in the newspapers. You are provided with the data
collected by Cody and your job is to design a machine learning model which given the features
extracted by Cody can predict air quality.
